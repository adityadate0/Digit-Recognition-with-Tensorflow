# Digit-Recognition-with-Tensorflow
With this project I finally stepped into the practical world of deep learning by building a simple five layer neural network which has been trained on the MNIST dataset. The sequential model was later tested on the digits which I wrote myself after they were processed to make them appear nearly like those from the training set.
The Repo contains a notebook and various images. These images contain the visualizations and graphs used to understand the test stats better.
